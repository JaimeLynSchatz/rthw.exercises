My code for Learn Ruby the Hard Way exercises

All errors are mine. The exercise assignments are all courtesy of the fantastic 
["Learn Ruby the Hard Way"](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/) by [Zed A. Shaw](http://learncodethehardway.org/)
and translated into Ruby from the original Python by [Rob Sobers](http://robsobers.com/).

**Learn Ruby the Hard Way** is one of the prerequisites for new students at the 
[Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/). I, unfortunately,
am not a student there this year, but I hope to have the chance some day. As a 
consolation (punishment?) for missing the application deadline, I am going through the open source portions of the [ADA 
curriculum](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/curriculum) to see what I can do in my "free" time.

Comments, questions, concerns, cookies (the edible kind) can be communicated (ok, running out of illerative words) 
through [GitHub](https://github.com/JaimeLynSchatz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EduPunkN00b) or 
[telepathy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xGnWLSD-5Q).
